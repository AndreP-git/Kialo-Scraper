54;1.0;con;This is a problem with culture and employment, not childbearing.;['3', '1', '1', '0', '1']
55;1.0;con;Preference for equality in the workforce is not a satisfactory reason for abortion.  Many childless women are treated unequally in the workforce as it is.  We can strive for equality whilst also supporting childbearing.;['1', '1', '2', '1', '1']
56;1.0;con;One of the reasons for unequal treatment of women in the workforce is the assumption that they will get pregnant and leave their job any time. If women are denied the option to terminate unwanted pregnancies, this further fuels such assumptions and encourages discrimination in the workplace.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
57;1.0;pro;The option to have an abortion gives women more autonomy over their careers, as it allows them to plan ahead and discuss maternity leave with their employers before actually needing it.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']

67;1.0;con;Better access to contraception and improved sexual education would reduce the risk of unplanned pregnancies.;['1', '1', '2', '3', '2']
68;1.0;pro;Abortion is a band-aid solution to systemic issues in society. While it may need to remain legal, it does nothing to address the reasons behind unwanted pregnancy.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '2']
69;1.0;con;The issue is that these resources are not properly allocated or presented to the populace. Women should not be made to suffer because of a failure of government.;['0', '1', '0', '1', '2']
70;1.0;pro;In many countries without strong state support for family planning services, doctors might be more inclined towards the lucrative work of performing abortions over the prescription of birth control - as was the case in Romania throughout the 1990s.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']
71;1.0;con;"The possibility of doctors being corrupt and state not having strong family planning services support are not variables that should come into play when deciding general legality of abortion.

72;1.0;con;Access to contraception will not help when many religious and cultural circles demand abstinence. Young women may have access to contraception but choose not to carry or use it because they are at a higher risk of being caught and punished for being sexually active.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '3']
73;1.0;con;A lot of those circles also ban abortion, so the justification of abortion by citing these situations is a fallacy. They already stigmatise abortion and demand carrying to full term, so they are an irrelevant factor in the discussion.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']

77;1.0;pro;In many countries, girls are more likely to be aborted, resulting in a disproportionate male-to-female ratio.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '3']
78;1.0;pro;In India, approximately 10 million girls were aborted between 1991 and 2011, which has led to there being 914 girls to every 1000 boys by 2011.;['1', '1', '2', '0', '1']
79;1.0;pro;A study found that some Indian-born immigrants in Canada are electively aborting female fetuses if they have already had two daughters.;['1', '2', '1', '1', '1']
80;1.0;con;The incidence of this is low, and the practice is likely to go away on its own as immigrants become settled.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '0']
81;1.0;pro;A study found that in Indian families where the firstborn was a girl, the second child was unnaturally likely to be a boy, whereas if the firstborn was a boy, sex ratios among subsequent children were normal.;['0', '2', '2', '0', '3']
82;1.0;pro;The study also found that second boys were not aborted, only second girls.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
83;1.0;con;This says more about gender equality than about the right of abortion. If there is a preferred gender, then that is the issue, not the abortion.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']
84;1.0;pro;When women are more likely to be aborted, this normalizes a narrative that women's lives are less important.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '1']
85;1.0;pro;In China, sons are often seen as more desirable. This is particularly the case in rural areas where sons are valued because of their ability to perform manual and agricultural work.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']
86;1.0;con;These narratives are being challenged and measures are being taken to prevent sex-selective abortions.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
87;1.0;con;This argument is easily separated from the larger argument by making it illegal to determine the sex of the fetus in these countries as is the case in countries like India already.;['1', '1', '1', '2', '1']
88;1.0;con;This approach undermines the freedom of couples to properly plan for their baby. There are legitimate medical and social reasons to find out the baby's sex ahead of time (e.g. preparing older siblings, intersex children, pure curiosity) that do not involve sex-based abortion. This unfairly limits all couple's options to prevent some couples from discriminatory abortions.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '1']
89;1.0;pro;Considering this topic regards whether the woman has the right to choose to terminate life, and not whether the father has any say, then support of the woman's right alone to choose is not a step for gender equality, but rather increases gender inequality.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '1']
90;1.0;pro;Abortion is an instrument of the patriarchy. It's a way men can use women as objects of sexual pleasure and escape the responsibilities of fatherhood. Sometimes women may decide to get an abortion because of pressure or threats from the father.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '0']
91;1.0;pro;A survey of 1000 women found 74% felt pressured by others while 30% chose abortion because they feared losing their man.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '2']
92;1.0;con;A survey of 1209 abortion patients found that fewer than 1% had abortions primarily because someone else insisted. Thus, in the majority of cases women would have their choice taken away by abortion being illegal, not legal.;['0', '0', '1', '1', '2']

99;1.0;pro;Post-abortal women report that their ability to respond to the remaining or future child(ren) can be manifested in several ways: a feeling of emotional numbness which leads to a lack of bonding, acting out of hostility and anger which can result in child abuse, and considering future children as “replacement children” who become overindulged (p. 11).;['0', '2', '0', '0', '1']
100;1.0;pro;After abortion, “replacement” children may find themselves the object of obsessive parenting styles of post-abortal parents who focus inordinate time, affection, or material goods on them. Parents may attempt to replace the lost child with a “wanted” child soon after the abortion. This can be detrimental to a child's development and behavior (p. 13).;['0', '0', '1', '0', '1']

108;1.0;con;If the pregnant individual obtains an abortion, the other party likely either agreed to it, in which case they affirmatively assented to the risk of negative impact, or the relationship was already on rocky foundations such that obtaining the abortion could not have significant causal effect on its health.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']

405;1.0;pro;Such an experiment demonstrates how abortion does not violate a fetus' right to life. Rather, it just deprives the fetus of the use of the pregnant person's body.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
406;1.0;con;The violinist example is not analogous because withdrawing support is very different from directly killing.

408;1.0;con;It is an assumption that all biological parents choose to create life and so accrue obligations to the fetus. In cases where parent do not deliberately concieve, the violinist is equivalent to a fetus and so the thought experiment holds true.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '0']

426;1.0;con;A sperm plus an egg would give rise to such a totipotent cell. If such a cell is of moral value, it stands to reason that what gives rise to it is also of moral value.

780;1.0;con;While postpartum depression is common, the risk of self-harm comes from postpartum psychosis which is more rare. The postpartum suicide rate is less than 2 out of every 100,000 births.

2989;1.0;con;"Morality by definition is not subjective. Preferences are entirely subjective and are neither right or wrong, they are just different tastes.

This suggests that people will have very different reactions to abortion depending on their beliefs, and reaffirms the view that it is therefore best for women determine the right choice for them.;['1', '0', '2', '1', '0']
3985;1.0;con;This study does not distinguish between mental health outcomes that occurred before abortions and those that occurred afterward, but still claimed to show a causal link between abortion and mental disorders.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '1']
3986;1.0;con;The mental hardships of pregnancy and the mental hardships of abortion are different for different people. Thus, women should be able to choose, based on their own needs.;['2', '0', '0', '1', '4']
3987;1.0;con;US researchers followed nearly 1,000 women who sought abortions nationwide for five years and found that those who had abortions did not experience more depression, anxiety, low self-esteem or dissatisfaction with life than those who were denied it.;['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']
3988;1.0;con;There might also be 'mental and physical consequences' if a woman has a baby she does not want. It is up to the woman to decide which course of action will cause them the least harm and she should be provided adequate information in order to do so.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
3989;1.0;pro;PPD can, in its serious form, result in postpartum psychosis (1/1000). Psychosis is one of the leading reasons for murdering children in the first year.

3997;1.0;pro;Intimate partner violence is common among women having abortions, with between 6% and 22% reporting recent violence from an intimate partner.

4422;1.0;con;The violinist example is not analogous because withdrawing support is very different from directly killing. In that example, the person did not create the violinist's dependency on their body whereas the parents are responsible for the creation of a fetus, thereby creating an obligation to provide due care.;['1', '1', '1', '1', '3']
4423;1.0;con;It is an assumption that all biological parents choose to create life and so accrue obligations to the fetus. In cases where parent do not deliberately concieve, the violinist is equivalent to a fetus and so the thought experiment holds true.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '0']
4424;1.0;con;This assumes that withdrawing support is different from direct killing. This distinction is unclear at best, since both cases involve a decision (terminate life) causally connected to a consequence (termination of life).;['1', '0', '2', '1', '0']

4652;1.0;con;A miscarriage or stillborn baby is 100% dead (or non-living, depending on your view).

4653;1.0;con;There are cases where an abortion would be for the best even when the mother wants the child.

5003;1.0;pro;According to the Guttmacher Institute, 88 percent of abortions occur within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with only 1.5 percent occurring after 21 weeks' gestation.
