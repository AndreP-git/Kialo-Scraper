# Kialo impact scraper

(Kialo)[kialo.com] is a platform of online debates. It is possible to download all the structure of a debate (for each intervention: stance, depth in the tree of debate and the claim).
However, it is not possible to download the impact and the votes given by the user to each intervention.  
This tool is based on Selenium, and its aim is to retrive the tuple (claim, list of votes) for each element of the debate tree
