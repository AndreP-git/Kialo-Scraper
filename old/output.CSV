49;1.0;con;This is a problem with culture and employment, not childbearing.;['3', '1', '1', '0', '1']
50;1.0;con;Preference for equality in the workforce is not a satisfactory reason for abortion.  Many childless women are treated unequally in the workforce as it is.  We can strive for equality whilst also supporting childbearing.;['1', '1', '2', '1', '1']
51;1.0;con;One of the reasons for unequal treatment of women in the workforce is the assumption that they will get pregnant and leave their job any time. If women are denied the option to terminate unwanted pregnancies, this further fuels such assumptions and encourages discrimination in the workplace.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
52;1.0;pro;The option to have an abortion gives women more autonomy over their careers, as it allows them to plan ahead and discuss maternity leave with their employers before actually needing it.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
53;1.0;con;Giving women the right to have an abortion if they want to does not oppose or contradict support for childbearing. Allowing women a choice does not make anything compulsory.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
54;1.0;pro;When women cannot afford to raise their children they are forced to go on welfare, which is a cost to everyone.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '1']
55;1.0;pro;Women who are denied abortions and instead give birth are 3.77 times more likely to be in poverty and 6.26 times more likely to be on public assistance 6 months after denial than women who received abortions. They are also more likely to be in poverty and remain on public assistance for 4 years after denial of abortion (pp. 411-412).;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
56;1.0;con;Society is best when we look out for others. Supporting people who need it through welfare is not necessarily a bad thing.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '2']
57;1.0;con;A case could be made that it would be better to have our tax dollars contributed to welfare, than have that same money be contributed to abortion.;['1', '2', '0', '0', '1']
58;1.0;pro;Many women who become pregnant are still in high school and are forced to drop out.;['1', '0', '2', '1', '0']
59;1.0;con;Governments should provide support to families to ensure that abortion is not the only option and that these financial issues are not significant.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
60;1.0;pro;There is evidence to suggest that the Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion in 1978 was responsible for the dramatic decrease in violent crime the United States experienced through at least 1999 (p. 414).;['1', '1', '0', '1', '1']
61;1.0;pro;There is evidence from Canada, Australia, and Romania that also supports the hypothesis that abortion reduces crime.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '3']
62;1.0;pro;Five US states legalised abortion three years before Roe v. Wade. Crime started falling three years earlier in these states, with property crime (committed by younger people) falling before violent crime.;['1', '2', '1', '1', '2']
63;1.0;con;The ends do not justify the means. Using an immoral act (abortion) to justify a good (improved crime rates) is unethical.;['1', '1', '0', '1', '0']
64;1.0;con;Individuals contribute to society in numerous different ways, and even children that are not wanted or raised well may make valuable contributions that mean society is better off.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '1']
65;1.0;con;It is possible to provide more education and access to resources and contraception to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies without relying on abortion.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
66;1.0;con;Even if society is better in some ways if women only have the children they want, this is not enough to justify killing the children. Otherwise, women would be permitted kill toddlers they are currently raising but don't want.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
67;1.0;con;Better access to contraception and improved sexual education would reduce the risk of unplanned pregnancies.;['1', '1', '2', '3', '2']
68;1.0;pro;Abortion is a band-aid solution to systemic issues in society. While it may need to remain legal, it does nothing to address the reasons behind unwanted pregnancy.;['2', '1', '1', '0', '2']
69;1.0;con;Access to contraception will not help when many religious and cultural circles demand abstinence. Young women may have access to contraception but choose not to carry or use it because they are at a higher risk of being caught and punished for being sexually active.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '3']
70;1.0;con;A lot of those circles also ban abortion, so the justification of abortion by citing these situations is a fallacy. They already stigmatise abortion and demand carrying to full term, so they are an irrelevant factor in the discussion.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
71;1.0;con;Abortion would not disappear no matter how accessible birth control and adoption becomes.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '2']
72;1.0;pro;Sweden's abortion statistics show that abortions will still happen, even in spite of the fact that many parts of the country provide heavily subsidised birth control for women up to their mid-twenties, free condoms at clinics, and free abortions up to 25-26.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
73;1.0;con;The issue is that these resources are not properly allocated or presented to the populace. Women should not be made to suffer because of a failure of government.;['1', '1', '0', '1', '2']
74;1.0;pro;In many countries without strong state support for family planning services, doctors might be more inclined towards the lucrative work of performing abortions over the prescription of birth control - as was the case in Romania throughout the 1990s.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
75;1.0;con;"The possibility of doctors being corrupt and state not having strong family planning services support are not variables that should come into play when deciding general legality of abortion. They circumvent the fundamental ""right to abortion"" issue by blaming external factors.";['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
76;1.0;con;Abortion worsens gender inequality.;['10', '5', '2', '1', '5']
77;1.0;pro;Abortion is an instrument of the patriarchy. It's a way men can use women as objects of sexual pleasure and escape the responsibilities of fatherhood. Sometimes women may decide to get an abortion because of pressure or threats from the father.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '0']
78;1.0;pro;A survey of 1000 women found 74% felt pressured by others while 30% chose abortion because they feared losing their man.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '2']
79;1.0;con;A survey of 1209 abortion patients found that fewer than 1% had abortions primarily because someone else insisted. Thus, in the majority of cases women would have their choice taken away by abortion being illegal, not legal.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '2']
80;1.0;pro;Considering this topic regards whether the woman has the right to choose to terminate life, and not whether the father has any say, then support of the woman's right alone to choose is not a step for gender equality, but rather increases gender inequality.;['1', '1', '2', '0', '1']
81;1.0;pro;In many countries, girls are more likely to be aborted, resulting in a disproportionate male-to-female ratio.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '3']
82;1.0;pro;In India, approximately 10 million girls were aborted between 1991 and 2011, which has led to there being 914 girls to every 1000 boys by 2011.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '1']
83;1.0;pro;A study found that some Indian-born immigrants in Canada are electively aborting female fetuses if they have already had two daughters.;['1', '2', '1', '1', '1']
84;1.0;con;The incidence of this is low, and the practice is likely to go away on its own as immigrants become settled.;['1', '1', '1', '1', '0']
85;1.0;pro;A study found that in Indian families where the firstborn was a girl, the second child was unnaturally likely to be a boy, whereas if the firstborn was a boy, sex ratios among subsequent children were normal.;['0', '2', '2', '0', '3']
86;1.0;pro;The study also found that second boys were not aborted, only second girls.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
87;1.0;con;This says more about gender equality than about the right of abortion. If there is a preferred gender, then that is the issue, not the abortion.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']
88;1.0;pro;When women are more likely to be aborted, this normalizes a narrative that women's lives are less important.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '1']
89;1.0;pro;In China, sons are often seen as more desirable. This is particularly the case in rural areas where sons are valued because of their ability to perform manual and agricultural work.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']
90;1.0;con;These narratives are being challenged and measures are being taken to prevent sex-selective abortions.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
91;1.0;con;This argument is easily separated from the larger argument by making it illegal to determine the sex of the fetus in these countries as is the case in countries like India already.;['1', '1', '1', '2', '1']
92;1.0;con;This approach undermines the freedom of couples to properly plan for their baby. There are legitimate medical and social reasons to find out the baby's sex ahead of time (e.g. preparing older siblings, intersex children, pure curiosity) that do not involve sex-based abortion. This unfairly limits all couple's options to prevent some couples from discriminatory abortions.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '1']
93;1.0;con;Late undesired pregnancy impedes the woman of performing her professional activities for a considerable period of time, thus, making her dependent on her partner, institutions and her family.;['1', '1', '0', '2', '1']
94;1.2;pro;There are many reasons a woman may not be equipped to or want to raise a child. In these cases, it is important that she is able to choose abortion.;['24', '11', '10', '22', '39']
95;1.0;pro;Pregnancy and parenthood are very expensive and time consuming. Many women who get abortions are already mothers, and they want to provide the best care they can to their existing children, financially, emotionally, and physically. This should be their choice.;['0', '0', '0', '2', '10']
96;1.0;pro;A study by University of California shows that existing children of women denied an abortion have 4 percentage point lower scores across all six domains of child development.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '0']
97;1.0;con;Abortion can have a negative effect on living children.;['1', '2', '0', '0', '1']
98;1.0;pro;Post-abortal women report that their ability to respond to the remaining or future child(ren) can be manifested in several ways: a feeling of emotional numbness which leads to a lack of bonding, acting out of hostility and anger which can result in child abuse, and considering future children as “replacement children” who become overindulged (p. 11).;['0', '2', '0', '0', '1']
99;1.0;pro;After abortion, “replacement” children may find themselves the object of obsessive parenting styles of post-abortal parents who focus inordinate time, affection, or material goods on them. Parents may attempt to replace the lost child with a “wanted” child soon after the abortion. This can be detrimental to a child's development and behavior (p. 13).;['0', '1', '1', '0', '1']
100;1.0;con;A vasectomy or tubal ligation would be adequate and less harmful in this scenario.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '1']
101;1.0;con;Some hospitals do not perform vasectomies or tubal ligations on religious grounds. (e.g. Many Catholic hospitals in Canada and the United States have not performed these services in the recent past, see links.) Therefore, this point only applies if these services are readily available and not themselves disallowed.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '2']
102;1.0;con;If the fetus is already a child, then it follows from your argument that one should be able to terminate one's offspring to better provide for the rest. This is immoral, and therefore, abortion for the reasons you presented is immoral.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '1']
103;1.0;pro;A woman might feel that her home does not provide a safe environment for a child.;['7', '1', '7', '2', '8']

105;1.0;pro;Women in physically violent and abusive relationships are likely to stay tethered to abusive partners when they are unable to terminate unwanted pregnancies. This puts both the women and their children at increased risk of violence.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '1']
106;1.0;pro;Intimate partner violence is common among women having abortions, with between 6% and 22% reporting recent violence from an intimate partner. Concern about violence is a reason some pregnant women decide to terminate their pregnancies as they do not wish to expose children to violence.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '0']
107;1.0;con;Governments have processes to remove children from these types of situations. This service alongside adoption, imprisonment, and help from family members saves countless children from harm.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '1']
108;1.0;pro;For example, in the United States, there are the Child Protective Services.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
109;1.0;con;It would be in the state's interest to have as few children taken away from their parents by Child Protective Services as possible. Denying these abortions would mean significant increases in public spending for various social care services.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
110;1.0;pro;In the long term, this would cause more trouble than allowing a woman to have an abortion when she wants one.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
111;1.0;pro;Abortion and birth control are fiscally responsible. Spending $235 million on family planning would save $1.32 billion.;['1', '0', '1', '0', '1']

121;1.0;pro;Private foster care agencies have allowed criminals and registered sex offenders to acquire licenses and adopt foster children. This has led to neglect, sexual abuse and murders of children.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']
122;1.0;pro;A caseworker in one such agency reported that three girls were happy and healthy in their foster home when in fact they had been dead for three months. This is indicative of the sheer ineptitude of many foster care agencies.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '2']
123;1.0;pro;Many LGBTQ children in foster homes suffer abuse. As a result, in the US, 56% spent some time homeless because they believed they were safer on the streets than they were in their foster homes (p. 5).;['1', '0', '2', '0', '2']

640;1.0;pro;A mother who fails to provide for her own child's basic needs such as food and water is guilty of child neglect, whereas someone who passes a stranger on the street begging for food and doesn't give them anything is not guilty of a crime.
